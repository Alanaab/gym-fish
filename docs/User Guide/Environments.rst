Enviroments
=============================
We propose four benchmark tasks that will be trained using RL.

4 tasks (Cruising, Pose control, Two-fish schooling, Path following).
3 underwater robots (koi, eel, flat-fish).

Cruising
--------
The robot fish tries to swim to reach a given
target location that is a distant away from the robot.

Pose control
------------
The robot fish tries to control its pose in
order to make a U-turn.

Two-fish schooling
------------------------
A robot fish follows a leader fish as closely as possible, where the leader fish is controlled to swim in a straight path.

Path following
---------------
A robot fish follows a given arbitrary path as closely and efficiently as possible.
